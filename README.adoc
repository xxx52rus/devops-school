### Git - cherry-pick

The git cherry-pick command is used to take the change introduced in a single Git commit and try to re-introduce it as a new commit on the branch you’re currently on. This can be useful to only take one or two commits from a branch individually rather than merging in the branch which takes all the changes.

History from master branch:
```sh
$ git branch
  feature-text-branch
* master
```
```sh
$ git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph
* 7e365d0 (origin/feature-text-branch) sentences feature added
* 8792cfb (feature-text-branch) long phrases added
* 9dc9fbd text added

### Git - tagging

A lightweight tag is very much like a branch that doesn’t change — it’s just a pointer to a specific commit.
Tag certain commit: `git tag v1.0 22efd50`.
Push it: `git push origin v1.0`.

Annotated tags, however, are stored as full objects in the Git database. They’re checksummed; contain the tagger name, email, and date; have a tagging message; and can be signed and verified with GNU Privacy Guard (GPG).
Tag certain commit with annotation: `git tag -a v1.1 fa1efd1 -m "release v1.1"`.
Push it: `git push origin v1.1`.

History
```sh
$ git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph
* fa1efd1 (HEAD -> master, tag: v1.1, origin/master, origin/HEAD) text added
| * 7e365d0 (origin/feature-text-branch) sentences feature added
| * 8792cfb long phrases added
| * 9dc9fbd text added
|/
*   ce52528 Merge pull request #1 from n1653/super-feature
|\
| * 22efd50 (tag: v1.0) super line added
|/
* 6dec4d5 +10
* f22f240 +9
* dce3cc0 +8
* d8fedcb +8
* 96154ba +7
* a86615b +6
…
```
if you need to make changes  - you will generally want to create a branch:
```sh
$ git checkout v1.0 -b v1.0
Switched to a new branch 'v1.0'
```
```sh
$ git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph
* fa1efd1 (tag: v1.1, origin/master, origin/HEAD, master) text added
| * 7e365d0 (origin/feature-text-branch) sentences feature added
| * 8792cfb long phrases added
| * 9dc9fbd text added
|/
*   ce52528 Merge pull request #1 from n1653/super-feature
|\
| * 22efd50 (HEAD -> v1.0, tag: v1.0) super line added
|/
* 6dec4d5 +10
* f22f240 +9
…

$ git branch --list
  master
* v1.0
```

### Git - ignore
 - Patterns read from the command line for those commands that support them.
 - Patterns read from a .gitignore file in the same directory as the path, or in any parent directory, with patterns in the higher level files (up to the toplevel of the work tree) being overridden by those in lower level files down to the directory containing the file. These patterns match relative to the location of the .gitignore file. A project normally includes such .gitignore files in its repository, containing patterns for files generated as part of the project build.
 - Patterns read from $GIT_DIR/info/exclude.
 - Patterns read from the file specified by the configuration variable core.excludesFile

```sh
$ echo "
# secrets
secrets*" >> ./.gitignore
```
```sh
$ git add ./secrets_01.conf
The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
secrets_01.conf
Use -f if you really want to add them.
```
```sh
$ git add ./*
The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
secrets_01.conf
Use -f if you really want to add them.
```

# Git – working with remote repositories

### Git - protocols

|===
|Protocol |Description

|SSH
|SSH simple, encrypted.
SSH is that it doesn’t support anonymous.
Predicaments with proxy may occur.

|HTTP
|Encrypted.
Providing your credentials is sometimes more complicated than using keys over SSH.

|GIT
|Unencrypted, no authentication.
Complicated.
The fastest network transfer protocol available.
Usually works as read-only along with HTTP/SSH for push.

|Local
|
|===

To change protocol clone repository and start working with the local copy:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/n1654/devops-school
$ cd ./devops-school/
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/n1654/devops-school (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/n1654/devops-school (push)
```
Chage 
```sh
$ git remote set-url origin git+ssh://git@github.com/n1654/devops-school
$ git remote -v
origin  git+ssh://git@github.com/n1654/devops-school (fetch)
origin  git+ssh://git@github.com/n1654/devops-school (push)
```

### Git - Athentication
#### Windows
Download and install [Git Credential Manager for Windows](https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows)
```sh
> git config --list | findstr "cred"
credential.helper=manager
```
#### Mac
osxkeychain - is working by default
```sh
% git config --list         
credential.helper=osxkeychain
user.name=Dmitrii Overchenko
user.email=dov@ubiqube.com
```
#### Using ssh-agent
Generate keys:
```sh
$ ssh-keygen -o
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/centos/.ssh/id_rsa): git-devops-school
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in git-devops-school.
Your public key has been saved in git-devops-school.pub.
```
change permissions:
```sh
$ chmod 400 ./git-devops-school.pub
```
verify protocols:
```sh
$ cd devops-school
$ git remote -v
origin  git+ssh://git@github.com/n1654/devops-school (fetch)
origin  git+ssh://git@github.com/n1654/devops-school (push)
```
start the ssh-agent in the background
```sh
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
Agent pid 23560
```
Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent
```sh
$ ssh-add ../git-devops-school
```
Login
```sh
$ ssh -T git@github.com
Hi n1654! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```
Now you can push without credentials prompt `git push origin master`

### Git - contributing

#### Fork

image:images/fork.png[size:50px]

If you want to contribute to an existing project to which you don’t have push access, you can “fork” the project. When you “fork” a project, GitHub will make a copy of the project that is entirely yours; it lives in your namespace, and you can push to it.

#### Pull Request

image:images/pr.png[size:50px]

1. Fork the project.
2. Create a topic branch from master.
3. Make some commits to improve the project.
4. Push this branch to your GitHub project.
5. Open a Pull Request on GitHub.
6. Discuss, and optionally continue committing.
7. The project owner merges or closes the Pull Request.
8. Sync the updated master back to your fork.
